# Ionic Intune Demo - Angular

This is a demo (written Angular) that demonstrates how to use Ionic's Intune integration to add Microsoft Intune policy protection and broker-based authentication to obtain access tokens to Microsoft services.

See [ionic-team/demo-intune-react](https://github.com/ionic-team/demo-intune-react) for a demo using React

## Capacitor and Cordova

This demo uses [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) which we _strongly_ recommend teams build with.

To see the Cordova demo, access the [cordova](https://github.com/ionic-team/demo-intune-angular/tree/cordova) branch.
